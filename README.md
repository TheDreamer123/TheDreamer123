# Hello, I'm TheDreamer123

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/TheDreamer123/TheDreamer123)

**This is my personal (and possibly also professional) GitHub where I post my public projects (which 99% is either a joke or something cursed).**

**I created this account and began posting my creations by modding Minecraft. But I am currently expanding my horizons.**

## Languages I worked with.

**I am recently new to programming, though, I've worked with a couple languages in the past, these include:**

* **C**
* **Java**
* **Python**
* **JavaScript**
* **PHP**
* **VBScript**
* **Batch**
* **COBOL**

**Though I am not proud of some, and neither am I advanced in all, I can understand a bit of a couple of them!**

**If you consider Brainfuck a programming language, I messed around a bit with it also.**

## What I'm currently using

**Obviously, I don't really use all languages I already had contact with, currently, I mostly use:**

* **C**
* **Java**
* **Python**

**I also recently explored Kotlin, I might try to learn further. Though not the biggest fan, it certainly is less verbose than Java!**

## My experience

**I am an indie developer, relatively recent, with only 4 years of experience. Though I never colaborated with other projects, I have several on my GitHub page. I am also mostly self-taught.**

## Want to get in contact?

**Well, I'd rather stay as private as possible, though, if you want to reach me, you can do so by commenting in the profile's project.**

### That's all... I guess...
